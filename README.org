#+TITLE: Tweaked version of =org-static-blog= (v1.5.0)

This is just my tweaked version of [[https://github.com/mikelRM/org-static-blog][=org-static-blog=]] at its version 1.5.0 (last
version at <2021-12-14 mar>). These are some of the *completed* changes:

** Changes
   
   - The post previews are shown in a table in =year= | =title= format.
   - In =archive.html= the post table also has a column for the tag list.
   - In =tags.html= only a list of categories is shown with the number of posts between parentheses.
   - The format of category lists change.
