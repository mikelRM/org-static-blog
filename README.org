#+TITLE: Tweaked version of =org-static-blog= (v1.5.0)

This is just my tweaked version of [[https://github.com/mikelRM/org-static-blog][=org-static-blog=]] at its version 1.5.0 (last
version at <2021-12-14 mar>). These are the *completed* and *wished* changes:

** DONE Changes
   

** TODO Changes

   - Better organization of the different pages in the static blog:

     #+begin_verse
     html
     |- index.html
     |- archive.html
     |- tag-archive.html
     |- ...
     |- posts
        |- post1.html
	|- post2.html
	|- ...
     #+end_verse
