#+TITLE: Tweaked version of =org-static-blog= (v1.5.0)

This is just my tweaked version of [[https://github.com/mikelRM/org-static-blog][=org-static-blog=]] at its version 1.5.0 (last
version at <2021-12-14 mar>). These are the *completed* and *wished* changes:

** DONE Changes
   

** TODO Changes
   
   - The list of posts in =index.html= and in the _general_ and _tag-restricted_
     archives are formatted in a table where it is shown the publication date
     and the title of the entry. This requires editing the definition of the
     function [[file:org-static-blog.el::defun org-static-blog-get-preview][~org-static-blog-get-preview~]], by doubling it and editing it to
     create the [[file:org-static-blog.el::defun org-static-blog-get-preview-table][~org-static-blog-get-preview-table~]] and using it.
